# Shortest-Path-Tree
Create vertecies by pressing on the screen, connect them with edges and run BFS on a specific vertex to create and see a shortest path tree as the pressed vertex as the tree source.

## Installation
* Clone the project repository or download the source code
* Install (or make sure you have):

  ```
  pip install pygame
  ```
  
* Run main.py

## Usage
* Double left-click to create a new vertex.
* Right click on two vertecies to create an edge between them.
* Middle mouse-click on a vertex to run a shortest path tree algorithm, making selected vertex the source.
* Press R to remove all vertecies and edges.
* Right clicking on a selcted vertex will unselect it.
